This is my Thesis project where i aim to predict the cell voltage during alkaline water electrolysis based on Zirfon diaphragm separator. 
The input parameters are as follows:
1. Temperature (oC)
2. Pressure (Bar)
3. Potassium hydroxide concentration (wt%)
4. Electrodes gap (mm)
5. Current density (a/cm^2)

Output:
1. Cell Voltage (V)
